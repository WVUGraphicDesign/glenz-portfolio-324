        <h2>Smart People: Case Study</h2>

        <img src="images/smart_poster.jpg">

        <p>For this project, I researched a TED Talk speaker and the topic they spoke on. I then created a poster, brochure and a digital media post advertising this event. For my speaker, I chose Bahia Shehab and her speech, A Thousand Times No. </p>

        <h2>Grafitti</h2>
        <p>Because Bahia used spray paint as her main form of expression, I knew I would need to use it in some way in my designs. So I created several templates of different “No’s” as well as a template of Bahia herself.</p>

        <h2>Color</h2>
        <p>While searching for my color palette and type, I knew I didn’t want this to feel like ancient Egypt so I looked at modern artwork and posters until I found this poster that was used during the Egyptian Revolution, an event that Bahia mentions throughout her talk.</p>
